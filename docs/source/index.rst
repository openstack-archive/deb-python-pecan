Introduction and History
========================
Welcome to Pecan, a lean Python web framework inspired by CherryPy,
TurboGears, and Pylons. Pecan was originally created by the developers
of `ShootQ <http://shootq.com>`_ while working at `Pictage
<http://pictage.com>`_.

Pecan was created to fill a void in the Python web-framework world â€“ a
very lightweight framework that provides object-dispatch style
routing.  Pecan does not aim to be a "full stack" framework, and
therefore includes no out of the box support for things like sessions
or databases (although tutorials are included for integrating these
yourself in just a few lines of code). Pecan instead focuses on HTTP
itself.

Although it is lightweight, Pecan does offer an extensive feature set
for building HTTP-based applications, including:

 * Object-dispatch for easy routing
 * Full support for REST-style controllers
 * Extensible security framework
 * Extensible template language support
 * Extensible JSON support
 * Easy Python-based configuration
