Contributing to Pecan
---------------------
Pecan uses GitHub pull requests for bug fixes and feature additions.

All contributions must:

    * Include accompanying tests.
    * Include narrative and API documentation if new features are added.
    * Be (generally) compliant with `PEP8
      <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
    * Not break the test or build.  Before submitting a review, ``$ pip
      install tox && tox`` from your source to ensure that all tests still pass
      across multiple versions of Python.

Bugs should be filed on GitHub:
